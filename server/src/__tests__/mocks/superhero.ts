    "Peter Parker, a shy high school student in New York City, was bitten by a radioactive spider during a science exhibit. The bite granted him incredible strength, agility, and the ability to cling to walls. Initially using his powers for personal gain, Peter's life took a tragic turn when his Uncle Ben was killed by a criminal Peter could have stopped. Consumed with guilt, Peter vowed to use his powers responsibly, embracing the mantra: With great power comes great responsibility. As Spider-Man, he now fights to protect his city, balancing his life as a hero and a regular teenager, while facing foes like the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, and countless others. ",
